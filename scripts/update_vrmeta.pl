Updates a VRTrack meta database from a sequence.index file.

Usage: $0 --samples sample.info --index sequence.index --database my_vrtrack_meta
        --g1k         sets samples, index, database to values suitable for
                      the main g1k project; merge_projects is turned on
        --samples     <file of sample info>
        --index       <sequence.index file>
        --database    <database name>
        --merge_projects (when specified, different projects that share the same
                          project style (eg. low coverage) and population will
                          have their disc locations specified the same)
        --ignore_changed_fastqs (when a fastq seems to have changed because the
                                 md5 is different comparing sequence.index and
                                 that already stored in the db for a file of a
                                 given name, don't worry about it. Useful for
                                 tracking -> meta database conversions, where
                                 the tracking md5 is for the uncompressed fastq)
        --only_update_changed_fastqs (when a fastq seems to have changed because
                                      the md5 is different, update the md5 in
                                      the db, but assume that the fastq data
                                      didn't really change - so don't trigger a
                                      reimport and remapping of this fastq)
        --all_updates (update lanes even when there are major changes,
                       like sample swaps and outright lane deletions)
        --update_withdrawn (in combination with --all_updates, will update major
                            changes to withdrawn lanes, which might be dangerous
                            if the details for withdrawn lanes are wrong and
                            clash with active lanes)
        --status      print a spinner to indicate activity
        --verbose     be extra verbose about what it is doing
        --help        <this message>

Sample info file is tab-delimited with columns:
lookup name (used to match the sequencescape sample name)
acc
individual name
alias (used for genotyping)
population name
species name
taxon id
sex

Sample info file is optional if all the necessary information has already been
added to the database with eg. load_vrtrack_allocations.pl
