=head1 NAME

Transposon.pm - Parse a fastq.gz file to find the percentage of tags that are present in reads

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use Pathogens::Parser::Transposon;
my $tradis_transposon = Pathogens::Parser::Transposon->new(
  filename   => 'myfile.fastq.gz',
  tag_length => 7,
);
$tradis_transposon->percentage_reads_with_tag ;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Calculate the percentage of tags that have mapped to reads in a fastq file.  
If the tag is unknown, work it out by sampling the file and taking the most frequently occuring tag. Only tags which are 100% present are counted.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

  Arg [1]    : filename   => fastq.gz file
               tag_length => integer with the tag length
               tag => user provided tag (optional)
               num_reads_to_sample => if a tag isnt provided, subsample this number of reads to find the most common tag, defaults to 1000, 0 samples whole file
  Example    :   my $tradis_transposon = Pathogens::Parser::Transposon->new(
                 filename   => 'myfile.fastq.gz',
                 tag_length => 7,
                 tag => 'ACGT');
  Description: returns Transposon object
  Returntype : Pathogens::Parser::Transposon object


=head2 percentage_reads_with_tag

  Arg [1]    : None
  Example    : my percentage_reads = $tradis_transposon->percentage_reads_with_tag ;
  Description: Find out the percentage of reads in a file with a common tag
  Returntype : Float
